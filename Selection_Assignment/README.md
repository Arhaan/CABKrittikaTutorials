## Python Assignment

What to do:

1. Make a private repository, and add the Jupyter Notebook and data files
2. Fill in the required code to complete the Problem_Statement Jupyter Notebook.
3. Push the notebook to the main branch of your repository.
4. After the deadline, make your repository public (you will be given a reminder)

Note : If you are unfamiliar with Python and/or Jupyter notebooks, you may find these tutorials by us useful - https://github.com/krittikaiitb/tutorials. 

We also conducted sessions on Python for the computational astronomy bootcamp (in which we covered the first four notebooks), the recordings of which are available on the MS Teams link - https://rb.gy/uge8gk . You will also of course find resources on everything needed for this online as well, so keep googling if you're stuck at any point!
